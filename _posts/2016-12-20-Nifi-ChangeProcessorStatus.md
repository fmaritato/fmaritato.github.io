title: Nifi Changing the status of a processor
---
So, you want to automate starting and stopping of your processors in Apache Nifi? Here is how to do it!
Essentially it boils down to making a PUT request against /processors/{id}. The trick is to know exactly
what data you need to include in the PUT. Mystery revealed! The TL;DR version is below, and I will go into
more detail afterward.

PUT /processors/f4ef13e8-1075-1157-f1fc-61a0096085f3

```json
{
    "revision": {
        "version": 1,
        "clientId": "c4cd2dc5-a57f-4025-aa4b-7e29118ce795"
    },
    "status": {
        "runStatus": "RUNNING"
    },
    "component": {
        "id": "f4ef13e8-1075-1157-f1fc-61a0096085f3",
        "state": "RUNNING"
    },
    "id": "f4ef13e8-1075-1157-f1fc-61a0096085f3"
}
```

The "revision" clause is required and should be directly copied from the result that is returned when you do a
GET /processor/{id} request. If the version doesn't match what Nifi thinks it is, you will get an error.
ClientId is generated by you and is any identifier. In this example, I generated a UUID.

The "component" clause is also required and contains the id of the processor and the desired state. The state should
be "RUNNING", "STOPPED" or "DISABLED".

The "status" clause just contains the desired state. This seems to be necessary even though it is duplicate data
from what is in the "component" clause but I was getting errors from the api and had to look through the source
code to figure out that this clause is necessary.

Finally, the "id" field is just the id of the processor. Again.

There you have it! Hope this helps in your journey to automating Apache Nifi.
